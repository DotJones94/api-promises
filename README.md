# api-promises
A small project that will get public api's and use them in a way to test out some promise logic.
Firstly, the thought was just to bring in multiple apis at the same time that replied on each other which then would 
a promise to make sure that they both come in at the right time, wait, then do logic. Another would use promises in 
another sense which does not need api's but shows how promises can help code. 

## APIs in use:
- A cocktail api form [here](https://rapidapi.com/thecocktaildb/api/the-cocktail-db/)
- A movie api from [here](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-alternative/)
